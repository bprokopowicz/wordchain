        <h2>How do I interpret the share graphic?</h2>
        <p>
        The WordChain score is how many <b>more</b> steps than
        WordChain's calculated <b>best solution</b> you used.
        If there were no extra steps, that is depicted with a star.
        If there were 5 extra steps, that is depicted with a confounded emoji.
        Otherwise, there is a number emoji indicating how many extra steps you made.
        The squares show the progression of the game:
        </p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            The purple squares depict the given start and target words.
            </li>
            <li>
            The green squares (blue in Colorblind Mode) indicate that the word played at that step was
            good, that is, on the shortest path to the target word.
            </li>
            <li>
            The red squares (orange in Colorblind Mode) indicate that the word played at that step was not
            an optimal choice, causing your solution to take more steps than the best solution.

            The gold squares indicate a GENIUS MOVE!
            </li>
            <li>
            The brown squares indicate a DODO MOVE!

        Note that only the Daily game can be shared.
        </p>
        <h2>What's this about a Genius Move?</h2>
        <p>
        WordChain draws its start and target words from a "common dictionary" of everyday words,
        and it uses that dictionary to determine the shortest path to the target word, indicated with
        all the blank letter cells at the start of the game.
        </p>
        <p>
        There is also an "advanced dictionary" that includes
        all the words in the common dictionary and many more.
        When you make a move (i.e. add, delete, or change a letter),
        the <i>advanced</i> dictionary is used to determine whether the resulting word is valid. 
        If so, the <i>common</i> dictionary is used to determine the layout of the
        subsequent letter cells that comprise the shortest path to the target word.
        A <b>Genius Move</b> occurs when you play a word that is <i>only</i> in the <i>advanced</i> dictionary
        <b>and</b> it leads to solving the game in fewer steps than WordChain's solution
        using only the <i>common</i> dictionary.
        </p>
        <h2>What's this about a Dodo Move?</h2>
        <p>
        If you make a move that increases the shortest path to the target word by 2,
        that is no ordinary wrong move -- it's a <b>Dodo Move</b>.
        This can only happen when adding or deleting a letter.
        </p>
        <h2>I want to pick a next word; how can I make a change that WordChain isn't suggesting?</h2>
        <p>
        You can't.
        WordChain is always aware of the shortest path to the target (using the common dictionary)
        and it only allows you to play the same kind of move
        that gets you to the next word on the shortest path.
        However, there is usually more than one move you can
        make and some of them will cause the solution to get longer.
        </p>
        <h2>Can I undo a move and go back to the prior word?</h2>
        <p>
        Sort of.
        WordChain will indicate what kind of move you must make next
        (add, delete, change indicated letter)
        to stay on the shortest path to the target.
        If WordChain has figured out that the best next move is to go back to the prior word,
        WordChain will indicate that you can make that change.
        For example:
        </p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            If you deleted a wrong letter,
            it's possible that the best next move is to put the letter back.
            WordChain will indicate that you must add a letter.
            </li>
            <li>
            Similarly, if you added a letter in the wrong place,
            it's possible that the best next move is to remove that letter.
            WordChain will indicate that you must remove a letter,
            </li>
            </ul>
        <p>
        In both cases, going back to the prior word
        may or may not be as good as the best next move;
        if not you will get a penalty.
        </p>

        <h2>What led you to create this game?</h2>
        <p>
        Well, it's a bit of a story.
        </p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            Bonnie created Version 1, called Word2Word,
            as a learning project in early 2014, in the interregnum between when she
            retired from Alcatel-Lucent and started her current position at CACI (which was then LGS Innovations).
            </li>
            <li>
            When Wordle became all the rage in late 2021/early 2022 it got us to thinking about
            that old game and whether we could resurrect and modernize it.
            We jointly did that and had Version 2 in playable form by the summer of 2022, but our enthusiasm fizzled.
            </li>
            <li>
            We completely reworked the user interface of the game in 2024, so you are playing Version 3.
            WordChain has its roots in the original game,
            but it is very different because the web of 2024 is quite a bit different from the web of 2014!
            </li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Is the original game still available?</h2>
        <p>
        Sadly, it is not. We have the Word2Word software,
        but that version partially ran on Heroku, one of the earliest cloud platforms. 
        Our account on Heroku was deleted for inactivity somewhere along the way.
        The Word2Word software from 2014 would be around 90 in human years.
