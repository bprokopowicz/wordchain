        <h2>How do I interpret the share graphic?</h2>
        <p>
        The score of the game is how many more steps than the best solution were made.
        If there were no extra steps, that is depicted with a star.
        If there were more than 5 extra steps, that is depicted with a confounded emoji.
        The squares show the progression of the game:
        </p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            The purple squares depict the given start and target words.
            </li>
            <li>
            The green squares (orange in Colorblind Mode) indicate that the word played at that step was
            good, that is, on the shortest path to the target word.
            </li>
            <li>
            The read squares (blue in Colorblind Mode) indicate that the word played at that step was not 
            an optimal choice, causing your solution to take more steps than the best solution.
            </li>
            <li>
            The gold stars indicate a GENIUS MOVE!
            </li>
            </ul>
        <p>
        Note that only the Daily game can be shared.
        </p>
        <h2>What's this about a Genius Move?</h2>
        <p>
        WordChain draws its start and target words from a "common dictionary" of everyday words,
        and it uses that dictionary to determine the shortest solution, indicated with
        all the blank letter cells at the start of the game.
        </p>
        <p>
        There is also an "advanced dictionary" that includes all the words in the common dictionary
        and many more.  When you make a move (i.e. add, delete, or change a letter),
        the <i>advanced</i> dictionary is used to determine whether the resulting word is valid. 
        If so, the <i>common</i> dictionary is used to determine the layout of the
        subsequent letter cells required to get to the target word.
        A Genius Move occurs when you play a word that is <i>only</i> in the <i>advanced</i> dictionary
        <b>and</b> it leads to solving the game in fewer steps than WordChain's solution
        using only the <i>common</i> dictionary.
        </p>
        <h2>What led you to create this game?</h2>
        <p>
        Well, it's a bit of a story.
        </p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            Bonnie created Version 1, called Word2Word,
            as a learning project in early 2014, in the interregnum between when she
            retired from Alcatel-Lucent and started her current position at CACI (which was then LGS Innovations).
            </li>
            <li>
            When Wordle became all the rage in late 2021/early 2022 it got us to thinking about
            that old game and whether we could resurrect and modernize it.
            We jointly did that and had Version 2 in playable form by the summer of 2022, but our enthusiasm fizzled.
            </li>
            <li>
            We completely reworked the user interface of the game in 2024, so you are playing Version 3.
            WordChain has its roots in the original game,
            but it is very different because the web of 2024 is quite a bit different from the web of 2014!
            </li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Is the original game still available?</h2>
        <p>
        Sadly, it is not. We have the Word2Word software,
        but that version partially ran on Heroku, one of the earliest cloud platforms. 
        Our account on Heroku was deleted for inactivity somewhere along the way.
        The Word2Word software from 2014 would be around 90 in human years.
