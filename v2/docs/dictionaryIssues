using WordFreqDict intersected with Scrabble words to create WordChainDict

idea: two dictionaries.
1) WordChainDict as defined above 
2) full scrabble dictionary

When solving, the app only uses WordChainDict.  When accepting input, use the full Scrabble dictionary, and ADD any
such words into the WordChainDict for the lifetime of the running app.  

This will allow the player to beat the solver by using obscure Scrabble words that the solver doesn't have access to.
In that case, there should be a separate Share that indicates you beat the solver.
