trying to set up NPM package

npm init --scope=@prokopowicz
this needs a git URL

-- did this, but still getting an error when running npm test:
Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/wordchain - Not found

from /users/bonnie/Projects ran:

npm install /Users/bonnie/Projects/wordchain

from /users/bonnie/Projects/wordchain:

npm publish

This failed with: 
npm ERR! code ENEEDAUTH
npm ERR! need auth This command requires you to be logged in to https://registry.npmjs.org/
npm ERR! need auth You need to authorize this machine using `npm adduser`

ran npm adduser
- username: prokopowicz
- password: as in pwsafe
- email: bonnie.prokopowicz@gmail.com

Got an email with a one-time password, which I copy/pasted

ran npm publish again and needed to remove "private": true from package.json

Then got an error that 'wordchain' is too similar to existing package 'word-chain'

Changed the "name" in package.json to fairoaks1

added dev-dependencies to fairoaks1 package, copied from heapify/package.json
update fairoaks1 version number
npm publish
npm i fairoaks1
  - now there are many modules in wordchain/node_modules, including ts stuff for jest.

getting error ts7016
added "types": "fairoaks1.d.ts", 
to package.json
=======================================================

I created the url 
git@github.com:bprokopowicz/wordchain.git

looks like to access it via command line we need github's CLI called gh

brew install gh

then authorize your shell session with
gh auth login -w 

To switch between 'prokopowicz' and 'bprokopowicz' github accounts
login to the one we want in the browser, then run gh auth login -w

GitHub config:
/Users/bonnie/.config/gh/hosts.yml - should have github user in it.


To get ssh key into github:
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy

git remote remove origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:bprokopowicz/wordchain.git
git remote -v (to list)

git push --set-upstream origin master
