Start web server:

    cd /Users/bonnie/Projects/
    python3 wordchain/python/simple-https-server.py

Navigate in Chrome:

    https://localhost/wordchain/docs/html/WordChain.html

=======================================================

I created the url
git@github.com:bprokopowicz/wordchain.git

looks like to access it via command line we need github's CLI called gh

brew install gh

then authorize your shell session with
gh auth login -w

USE HTTPS
To switch between 'prokopowicz' and 'bprokopowicz' github accounts
login to the one we want in the browser, then run gh auth login -w

GitHub config:
/Users/bonnie/.config/gh/hosts.yml - should have github user in it.


To get ssh key into github:
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy

git remote remove origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:bprokopowicz/wordchain.git
git remote -v (to list)

git push --set-upstream origin master

TESTING - How to run the browser-based tests:

    - Disable logging (Const.GL_DEBUG) in Const.js for initial testing.  If Const.GL_DEBUG is true, the tests take much longer to run, even
      if the Debug local-storage-key is not set.  You may need to edit Test.js to limit which tests will run if you're going to
      run them with logging enabled.

    - Start the web server as described above.

    - Navigate in browser (local or remote) to:

        https://localhost/wordchain/docs/html/Test.html   (browser running locally)
        https://ip-addr/docs/html/Test.html   (browser running remotely)

        You may be warned about opening an unsafe site.  This is because our https certificate is not official.  You need to

    - Optional: Open the browser's javascript console

    - click on "Run All Tests"
        You may be warned by the browser about pop-ups.  You need to allow them.

    - The tests will produce logging if you set the Debug local-storage key's value to include the label: test
         The test logging doesn't use Const.GL_DEBUG to enable itself.  It is always on if the Debug local-storage key's
         value includes test.

TROUBLESHOOTING
    - Enable logging with Const.GL_DEBUG = true;
    - Each js file uses the logDebug(msg, tag) feature to log progress.  The Debug local-storage key is a comma-separated list of tags; for example:
      game,picker,callback,solver,dictionary-details,test
      Set the Debug key's value in the browser (Application/Storage/Local storage/https://localhost tab in Chrome's dev tool window).
    - The pop-up windows have their own console.  You can view them in Chrome by clicking on the window and typing Option-Command-I
      If the windows disappear before you can see their console, you need to edit the particular app test and comment out "this.runNextTest()" in the test
      you want to pause with the window open.
