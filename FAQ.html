    <h1 align=center>WordChain FAQ</h1>
        <h2>How can I make WordChain available on my phone or tablet home screen? </h2>
        <p>
        That's an easy one.
        <ul>
        <li>
        In the browser of your choice, navigate to wordchainfun.com.
        </li>
        <li>
        Now click the browser's Share button (icon is a square with an arrow pointing up),
        which is not always in the same place by default:
        </li>
        <ul>
        <li>
        Safari/iPhone: at the bottom of the screen, in the middle.
        </li>
        <li>
        Safari/iPad and Chrome: at the top of the screen, to the right of the search bar.
        </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
        Scroll vertically and click 'Add to Home Screen'.
        </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>How do I interpret the share graphic?</h2>
        <p>
        The WordChain score is how many <b>more</b> steps than
        WordChain's calculated <b>best solution</b> you used,
        plus the number times you clicked 'Show Next Move'.
        If there were no extra/shown steps, that is depicted with a star.
        If there were 5 extra/shown steps (a lost game), that is depicted with a confounded emoji.
        Otherwise, there is a number emoji indicating how many extra/shown steps you made.
        The squares show the progression of the game:
        </p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            The purple squares depict the given start and target words.
            </li>
            <li>
            The green squares (blue in Colorblind Mode) indicate that the word played at that step was
            good, that is, on the shortest path to the target word.
            </li>
            <li>
            The red squares (orange in Colorblind Mode) indicate that the word played at that step was not
            an optimal choice, causing your solution to take more steps than the best solution.
            </li>
            <li>
            The gray squares indicate a word shown with the 'Show Next Move' button
            or words at the end of a lost game.
            </li>
            <li>
            The gold squares indicate a GENIUS MOVE!
            </li>
            </ul>
        <p>
        Note that only the Daily game can be shared and sharing is only available if
        you don't use the Solution button to see the answer.
        </p>

        <h2>What's this about a Genius Move?</h2>
        <p>
        WordChain draws its start and target words from a "common dictionary" of everyday words,
        and it uses that dictionary to determine the shortest path to the target word, indicated with
        all the blank letter cells at the start of the game.
        </p>
        <p>
        There is also an "advanced dictionary" that includes
        all the words in the common dictionary and many more.
        When you make a move (i.e. add, delete, or change a letter),
        the <i>advanced</i> dictionary is used to determine whether the resulting word is valid.
        If so, the <i>common</i> dictionary is used to determine the layout of the
        subsequent letter cells that comprise the shortest path to the target word.
        A <b>Genius Move</b> occurs when you play a word that is <i>only</i> in the <i>advanced</i> dictionary
        <b>and</b> it leads to solving the game in fewer steps than WordChain's solution
        using only the <i>common</i> dictionary.
        </p>

        <h2>Why can't I share directly to an app like Facebook, text, email?</h2>
        <p>
        In a word: Facebook (and possibly other apps).
        If you directly share to Facebook, and the content includes a URL,
        Facebook ONLY sends the URL -- no graphic. Sigh.
        Our many attempts to subvert this behavior failed miserably.
        So instead, WordChain copies the graphic and URL to yoru clipboard,
        and from there you must paste it in an email, text message,
        or the app where you want to share it.
        </p>

        <h2>What time does the daily game change?</h2>
        <p>
        Midnight in your local timezone.
        </p>

        <h2>I've used up all my practice games; when do I get more?</h2>
        <p>
        Midnight in your local timezone.
        </p>

        <h2>Sometimes I make a move that I don't mean to; can I undo it?</h2>
        <p>
        Not exactly, but you can turn on "confirmation mode" in the settings screen.
        This is setting is off by default;
        click the header button with the gear on it and click the checkbox
        to select confirmation mode.
        In this mode, when you click/tap a plus/minus/letter,
        the yellow button will turn gray and you must tap it again to confirm it
        (or you can tap a different button to change your move and then you must confirm that).
        </p>

        <h2>Why aren't my stats consistent across my devices?</h2>
        <p>
        WordChain does not ask you to login or create a user ID;
        it has no notion of who you are.
        The game keeps track of a player on a particular device
        and each browser app you run on that device.
        Therefore, there is no way to retrieve stats, game-in-progress,
        or other information that occurred on one device when playing on another.
        The same applies to sharing between browser apps, even on the same device.
        </p>

        <h2>What constitutes a streak?</h2>
        <p>
        A streak is the number of consecutive daily games you have played and won.
        If you skip a day and then win a game, you streak will restart at 1.
        If you lose a game, your streak will be reset to 0.
        Note that like other stats, your streak is not shared across
        your devices and browser apps.
        If the streak important to you, you should always play WordChain
        using the same device and browser app.
        </p>

        <h2>I want to pick a next word; how can I make a change that WordChain isn't suggesting?</h2>
        <p>
        You can't.
        WordChain is always aware of a shortest sequence of moves to the target (using the common dictionary).
        When there are multiple such paths, WordChain picks one,
        and it only allows you to play the type of move
        that gets you to the next word on <b>that selected path</b>.
        Note that even with the type of move WordChain requires,
        there is usually more than one move you can
        make and some of them will cause the solution to get longer.
        </p>

        <h2>I've thought of a solution that has the same number of steps
        or fewer than displayed; why won't WordChain let me play it?</h2>
        <p>
        WordChain has a solution with the number of steps shown,
        and that solution determines the type of next move you are allowed to make.
        If your solution requires a different next move (e.g. changing a different letter
        or adding instead of deleting a letter), WordChain will not let you play it.
        </p>
        <p>
        Your solution might include an advanced word; WordChain uses <b>only the common dictionary</b>
        to construct a shortest path solution, which determines the next type of move it suggests.
        Because of this, you might even have thought of a solution that involves a Genius Move that
        would result in a shorter solution than WordChain's, but you may not be able to play it.
        (See also the previous question, which is related.)
        </p>

        <!--
        <h2>Can I undo a move and go back to the prior word?</h2>
        <p>
        Sort of.
        WordChain will indicate what kind of move you must make next
        (add, delete, change indicated letter)
        to stay on the shortest path to the target.
        If WordChain has figured out that the best next move is to go back to the prior word,
        WordChain will indicate that you can make that change.
        For example:
        </p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            If you deleted a wrong letter,
            it's possible that the best next move is to put the letter back.
            WordChain will indicate that you must add a letter.
            </li>
            <li>
            Similarly, if you added a letter in the wrong place,
            it's possible that the best next move is to remove that letter.
            WordChain will indicate that you must remove a letter,
            </li>
            </ul>
        <p>
        In both cases, going back to the prior word
        may or may not be as good as the best next move;
        if not you will get a penalty.
        </p>
        -->

        <h2>Why can't I use a keyboard to enter letters when I am on a device that has one?</h2>
        <p>
        We made a design decision to keep the interface as consistent as possible
        across device types so that the playing experience is similar wherever you play.
        That said, we recognize that the letter picker works more naturally on a device with a touch screen.
        <p>

        <h2>Why do some of the blank letter cells have thick outlines?</h2>
        <p>
        WordChain shows blank letter cells for the shortest solution from the current point in the game,
        which provide a hint as to how best to solve it.
        In words where the the move is to change a letter,
        the outline of the letter that should be changed is thicker;
        this provides a further solving hint.

        <h2>Why does the Share button use the clipboard?</h2>
        <p>
        If you're using Chrome, you can enable the browser's web share feature that will let you send by text, email, etc.
        To do this, copy and paste this address into your Chrome browser address bar and then enabling
        the web-share feature: <p>chrome://flags/#web-share</p>

        In the Firefox browser, there is no similar setting.

        <h2>What led you to create this game?</h2>
        <p>
        Well, it's a bit of a story.
        </p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            Bonnie created Version 1, called Word2Word,
            as a learning project in early 2014, in the interregnum between when she
            retired from Alcatel-Lucent and started her current position at CACI (which was then LGS Innovations).
            </li>
            <li>
            When Wordle became all the rage in late 2021/early 2022 it got us to thinking about
            that old game and whether we could resurrect and modernize it.
            We jointly did that and had Version 2 in playable form by the summer of 2022, but our enthusiasm fizzled.
            </li>
            <li>
            We completely reworked the user interface of the game in 2024, so you are playing Version 3.
            WordChain has its roots in the original game,
            but it is very different because the web of 2024 is quite a bit different from the web of 2014!
            </li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Is the original game still available?</h2>

        <p>
        Sadly, it is not. We have the Word2Word software,
        but that version partially ran on Heroku, one of the earliest cloud platforms.
        Our account on Heroku was deleted for inactivity somewhere along the way.
        The Word2Word software from 2014 would be around 90 in human years.
