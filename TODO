Production TODO
===============

Must Do
-------
- How to create/minify/obfuscate one big js file?
- Buy domain wordchain.com or some such?
- Where to host?
- How to manage daily game words long-term?
- Address/remove any TODO-PRODUCTION
- Change Const.WORD_CHAIN_EPOCH_DATE
- Remove all rare words from standard dictionary (done through 'B') 1/28

Discuss
-------

BLP says we should do these:
- Logo/favicon.ico -- we should see if we can find someone who
  will design a logo for a reasonable price, and perhaps suggest
  changes to styling in the game.
- Consider changing Daily game to roll over at midnight local time  (Already done)
- Consider changing Practice game window to align with Daily game window
- Should "shown" rows be a different color (currently green, maybe show gray)?

BLP says only do these if it really catches on:
- Create a back-end that delivers the daily and practice games
- Cookies: make secure? Obfuscate? Save in back-end DB?

BLP says ask what our Beta users think on these:
- Consider changing to "par scoring"
  - WordChain's initial length is par
  - Score is -N if N words greater than par
  - Score is +N if N words less than par
- When we show the solution, it solves the game as played so far.  It should also
  show the best solution as played by the user until their first mistake, and then
  continued optimally.  This display doesn't need to be on a display grid like the game.
  It could just be a vertical list of the words.  This optimal solution might be different
  from WordChain's original solution, but of the same length.  We could have ANOTHER
  button to Show WordChain's Original solution.
- Mode where future rows do not have change cells outlined thicker. (harder)
- Don't make the player select the last letter when there is only one step left?
  This prevents fat-fingering the last letter choice.

BLP has no opinion on:
- Consider removing words that are in both dictionaries from the Scrabble dictionary
  PNP: no.  Scrabble dictionary must be a superset of the standard dictionary for reliable on-going edits to the std dictionary.
- Address slow handler violations:
     [Violation] 'click' handler took XXXms
        (can happen when switching to Practice game or starting new Practice game)
     [Violation] 'setInterval' handler took XXXms
        (can happen when the AppDisplay interval timer determines it's time for a new Daily game)

Testing Issues
==============

In IOS (phone, ipad) using Safari, wordchain.html will load and play OK, BUT:
- if you force a hard reload (cmd-opt-R) from the web inspector while tethered to a Mac,
  the javascript downloading fails for 2-4 of the files.
- also, BaseLogger.js seems to take too long but does download. You can see this in the Web
  Inspector on the Mac when tethered to the iPad. We haven't tethered a phone yet (Nov 8, 2024)
- only occurs when device is tethered

TODO - verify that hard reload doesn't work on iphone/safari (untethered).
TODO - can we force hard-reload on iphone/ipad in Chrome? Does that require tethering?
    NOTE: If we clear the Safari's cache on iPad via Settings --> Safari --> Clear History and Website Data
          and then go back to Safari, the app seems to reload everything just fine (tethered or not).

The JS download failure has strange aspects.
- Web Inspector/network shows that 2-4 JS files never load.
  - They are in the green "waiting" phase, but if you look at the "Headers" tab in WebInspector,
    you will see there are no requests made for those pages.
  - And the web server doesn't show any request.
