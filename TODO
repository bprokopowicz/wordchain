Known Bugs

Production TODO
===============

Must Do
-------
- How to manage daily game words long-term?
- Address/remove any TODO-PRODUCTION
- Change Const.WORD_CHAIN_EPOCH_DATE
- Fix Const.PRACTICE_GAMES_PER_DAY
- Remove all rare words from standard dictionary (done through 'B') 1/29

Maybe Do
---------
- Consider changing Practice game window to align with Daily game window

Second Beta TODO
================

- Set up at hostinger.com with domain WordChainGame.com
  - Use index.html at the root instead of docs/html/WordChainBundle.html?
- More daily game words
- Execute automated tests and manual test use cases:
  - Safari iPhone
  - Safari iPad
  - Chrome Mac
- Seek user input on:
  - Should the game automatically select the very last letter?
  - Show Solution button:
    - Should it require confirmation?
    - Should letters in "shown" rows be a different color to indicate the user
      didn't enter them (currently shown green, maybe show gray)?
  - What would you think of having a hint button that would make the next
    optimal move?
    - If you think that would be a good addition, should we limit the number
      of hints per game?
    - Regardless of number of hints, they  would have to show up in the share
      somehow, such as a different color (gray?) in the graphic.

Maybe Someday
=============

- Another hint approach:
  - When you are changing a letter, letters in the picker that don't form valid
    words (according to either dictionary) would become unselectable.
  - When you are adding a letter, "+" buttons where there are no valid words
    (according to the "common words" dictionary) would become unselectable.
  - When you are deleting a letter, "-" buttons where the result is an invalid
    word would become unselectable.
- Create a back-end that delivers the daily and practice games
- Cookies: make secure? Obfuscate? Save in back-end DB?
- Mode where future rows do not have change cells outlined thicker. (harder)
- Address slow handler violations:
     [Violation] 'click' handler took XXXms
        (can happen when switching to Practice game or starting new Practice game)
     [Violation] 'setInterval' handler took XXXms
        (can happen when the AppDisplay interval timer determines it's time for a new Daily game)

Testing Issues
==============

In IOS (phone, ipad) using Safari, wordchain.html will load and play OK, BUT:
- if you force a hard reload (cmd-opt-R) from the web inspector while tethered to a Mac,
  the javascript downloading fails for 2-4 of the files.
- also, BaseLogger.js seems to take too long but does download. You can see this in the Web
  Inspector on the Mac when tethered to the iPad. We haven't tethered a phone yet (Nov 8, 2024)
- only occurs when device is tethered

TODO - verify that hard reload doesn't work on iphone/safari (untethered).
TODO - can we force hard-reload on iphone/ipad in Chrome? Does that require tethering?
    NOTE: If we clear the Safari's cache on iPad via Settings --> Safari --> Clear History and Website Data
          and then go back to Safari, the app seems to reload everything just fine (tethered or not).

The JS download failure has strange aspects.
- Web Inspector/network shows that 2-4 JS files never load.
  - They are in the green "waiting" phase, but if you look at the "Headers" tab in WebInspector,
    you will see there are no requests made for those pages.
  - And the web server doesn't show any request.
