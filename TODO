Implementation Ideas (Future)
- Solution button -- add means to show WordChain's ORIGINAL solution?
- After a game fails should the solution be shown?
  If so from the point of failure onward?
  Or by the same means to show WordChain's original solution?
- Possible settings to tweak game difficulty:
  - Mode where future rows do not have change cells outlined thicker. (harder)
  - Mode where picker displays only letters that could result in valid words. (easier)
- Don't make the player select the last letter when there is only one step left? This prevents fat-fingering the last letter choice.

Testing
- Update Manual UI Testing Use Cases doc
  (https://docs.google.com/document/d/10OhXfsQWpEvvLodChFl1e-K8VdjBBmx7-jTihKBI1sE/edit?usp=sharing)
- Update Testing How-To doc
  (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b8b2sDs3SFpffsEPO70uufia7UOJBccSUclHI4u9u8Y/edit?usp=sharing)
  - query parameters for practice games: start, target, minutes_per_day, whatever else
  - red sections

Bugs
- 'Solved!' toast pops up when changing settings (colorblind or dark modes)
- don't show solution button in Daily Game if the puzzle is either solved or shown
- TODO-BETA in AuxiliaryDisplay.js -- log the value of window

Production
- How to create/minify/obscure one big js file
- Buy domain wordchain.com?
- Where to host?
- How to manage daily game words long-term?
- Cookies: make secure? Obfuscate? Save in back-end DB?
- Logo/favicon.ico

daily game use cases:
1) no recovered game number - calculate current game and initialize it
2) recovered game number - calculate today's game number and compare:
   a) not the same: initialize today's game number
   b) the same: recover played moves and 'shown' flag
      i) shown is false, played moves are complete
          recover the game as solved
      ii) shown is false, played moves are incomplete
          recover the game in progress
      iii) shown is true, played moves are complete
           recover the game as finished, leave shown flag as true
      iv) shown is true, played moves are incomplete:
          this is a bug.  finish playing the game, save the solved state, leave 'shown' flag as true
