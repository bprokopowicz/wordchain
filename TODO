BUGS:
It now fails if you enter a non-word.  It is stuck there and throws an exception.

document how to run tests - js and python.

Don't show extra tile if it is not the best path.  

For "delete one letter" step, show the whole word (again, below previous word) with an 'x' in the corner of
each letter that can be removed and create a word THAT HAS A SOLUTION PATH.   
If they remove the correct letter - redraw with that letter gone, in green.
If they remove the wrong letter and not a word, show 'not in word list' and leave the display the same.
If they remove the wrong letter and it is a word, redraw in red and continue

For add a letter - two ideas:
1) show the whole word with a box for the new letter.  One key stroke to add the letter already in the right place.  
This is easier to play.  Do this first.  If it is too easy, try idea 2.
2) place a caret between each letter and at front and back.  Click on that to open a new box right there.  Then type
the letter.  This has complications: the new box may be a dead end - no letter fits.  If a letter does fit, there is 
always a solution, which in the worst case is deleting that letter and replaying a word.  Is that allowed?
NEED TO ALLOW REPLAYING A WORD.  Another complication: If they add the new letter space in a place where no word
is possible.  Maybe only show the carets where a word is possible.  Or, to be friendlier, only put carets if you
can add a letter there and still be on the best path.

python V2 
    need to update the python tests for v2
