Implementation
- Solution button -- add means to show WordChain's ORIGINAL solution?
- After a game fails should the solution be shown?
  If so from the point of failure onward?
  Or by the same means to show WordChain's solution?
- Possible settings to tweak game difficulty:
  - Mode where future rows do not have change cells outlined thicker. (harder)
  - Mode where picker displays only letters that could result in valid words. (easier)
- Practice game bugs
  - restarting an existing practice game counts as another play.  It creates another timestamp.  Timestamps should only happen
    on new games.
- It looks like "cookies" local storage works across windows automatically.  Probably we can remove the per-window cookie saving stuff.

- Resolve all TODOs!

Testing
- Update test plan (https://docs.google.com/document/d/10OhXfsQWpEvvLodChFl1e-K8VdjBBmx7-jTihKBI1sE/edit?usp=sharing)
- Tweak for display on iPhone/iPad

Before Sharing with Initial Friends
- Review help message
- 30 days of daily games
- Execute test plan on iPhone/iPad (Safari) and desk/laptop (Safari/Chrome)

Notes on recovery of daily game

use cases:
1) no recovered game number - calculate current game and initialize it
2) recovered game number - calculate today's game number and compare:
   a) not the same: initialize today's game number
   b) the same: recover played moves and 'shown' flag
      i) shown is false, played moves are complete
          recover the game as solved
      ii) shown is false, played moves are incomplete
          recover the game in progress
      iii) shown is true, played moves are complete
           recover the game as finished, leave shown flag as true
      iv) shown is true, played moves are incomplete: 
          this is a bug.  finish playing the game, save the solved state, leave 'shown' flag as true
