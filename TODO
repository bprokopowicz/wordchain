  - More practice words

Questions of Beta Users

- After every game (daily or practice)
    what were the words
    what was your score (0 to 4 or fail)
    your reaction in 10 words or less (too easy, good game, too hard, boring, frustrating, ...)
- Is it a fun game?
- Is it too hard or too easy?
- Is it easy to understand/use?
- Anything unintuitive in the user interface?
- Any bugs?
- Any suggested enhancements?
- Especially interested in these environments:
  - Android phone
  - Edge browser

Production TODO

- How to create/minify/obscure one big js file
- Buy domain wordchain.com?
- Where to host?
- Create a back-end that delivers the daily and practice games
- How to manage daily game words long-term?
- Cookies: make secure? Obfuscate? Save in back-end DB?
- Logo/favicon.ico
- Consider removing words that are in both dictionaries from the Scrabble dictionary
- Consider changing to "par scoring"
  - WordChain's initial length is par
  - Score is -N if N words greater than par
  - Score is +N if N words less than par
- Address slow handler violations:
     [Violation] 'click' handler took XXXms
        (can happen when switching to Practice game or starting new Practice game)
     [Violation] 'setInterval' handler took XXXms
        (can happen when the AppDisplay interval timer determines it's time for a new Daily game)

Implementation Ideas (Future)

- Solution button -- add means to show WordChain's ORIGINAL solution?
- Should "shown" rows be a different color (currently green, maybe show gray)?
- After a game fails should the solution be shown?
  If so from the point of failure onward?
  Or by the same means to show WordChain's original solution?
- When we show the solution, it solves the game as played so far.  It should also
  show the best solution as played by the user until their first mistake, and then
  continued optimally.  This display doesn't need to be on a display grid like the game.
  It could just be a vertical list of the words.  This optimal solution might be different
  from WordChain's original solution, but of the same length.  We could have ANOTHER
  button to Show WordChain's Original solution.
- Possible settings to tweak game difficulty:
  - Mode where future rows do not have change cells outlined thicker. (harder)
  - Mode where picker displays only letters that could result in valid words. (easier)
- Don't make the player select the last letter when there is only one step left? This prevents fat-fingering the last letter choice.


Testing issues (only occurs when device is tethered)

In IOS (phone, ipad) using Safari, wordchain.html will load and play OK, BUT:
- if you force a hard reload (cmd-opt-R) from the web inspector while tethered to a Mac,
  the javascript downloading fails for 2-4 of the files.
- also, BaseLogger.js seems to take too long but does download. You can see this in the Web
  Inspector on the Mac when tethered to the iPad. We haven't tethered a phone yet (Nov 8, 2024)

TODO - verify that hard reload doesn't work on iphone/safari (untethered).
TODO - can we force hard-reload on iphone/ipad in Chrome? Does that require tethering?
    NOTE: If we clear the Safari's cache on iPad via Settings --> Safari --> Clear History and Website Data
          and then go back to Safari, the app seems to reload everything just fine (tethered or not).

The JS download failure has strange aspects.
- Web Inspector/network shows that 2-4 JS files never load.
  - They are in the green "waiting" phase, but if you look at the "Headers" tab in WebInspector,
    you will see there are no requests made for those pages.
  - And the web server doesn't show any request.
