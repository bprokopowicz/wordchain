Known Bugs
==========

- If Daily game is in progress and we redefine the start/target words for that game
  number in a prod update, it screws up any game in progress or finished that started
  with the previous definition.

Near Term Changes
=================

- Finish up "less negative user experience" work:
  - Migration of stats in cookie -- any changes needed?
  - Update video
- Test coverage
- Resolve TODOs
- Update manual tests and run them

Dictionary
==========
remove unreachable words (easy)
remove unreachable cliques of less than N words (hard)

Analytics
=========
Our Google tag ID is G-ESCKD20EKK.  This is a Google Analytics 4 (GA4) tag.  
It seems like GA4 supports counting events by type but not by individual user.  So we can track things like:
- game #abc started at timestamp
- game #abc finished in N moves, streak at K, at timestamp
Things we can't do or maybe complicated:
- user WCIDxyz has played 43 games

Maybe Someday
=============

Affecting Game Play
-------------------
- Another hint approach:
  - When you are changing a letter, letters in the picker that don't form valid
    words (according to either dictionary) would become unselectable.
  - When you are adding a letter, "+" buttons where there are no valid words
    (according to the "common words" dictionary) would become unselectable.
  - When you are deleting a letter, "-" buttons where the result is an invalid
    word would become unselectable.
- Mode where future rows do not have change cells outlined thicker. (harder)
- Allow "overriding" WordChain's suggested next move type (including which letter to change).
  - 'My Way' button
  - Will need to bring back keyboard
  - Still must conform to single change per move (add/del/change one letter)
- Option to exclude advanced dictionary from being used.
  - Addresses Steven's irritation:
    - Getting dinged when a word is in the advanced dictionary, and results
      in a longer path using only words from common dictionary, when an equal
      path using other words in advanced dictionary is possible.
    - But maybe the 'My Way' button would obviate the need for this?

Not Affecting Game Play
-----------------------
- Create a back-end that delivers the daily and practice games
- Cookies: make secure? Obfuscate? Save in back-end DB?
- Remove words from dictionary if they have no neighbors.
- Address slow handler violations:
     [Violation] 'click' handler took XXXms
        (can happen when switching to Practice game or starting new Practice game)
     [Violation] 'setInterval' handler took XXXms
        (can happen when the AppDisplay interval timer determines it's time for a new Daily game)
- Create a clock manager clas; would affects
  - GameState.resetPracticeGameCounter()
  - AppDisplay.resetPracticeGameCounter()
  - AppDisplay.createScreens() where AppDisplay.resetPracticeGameCounter() is called
- Daily game maintenance
  - Move game definitions into a separate data file, which is retrieved by daily game factory on demand
  - Replace BROKEN GAME with a randomly selected earlier game, where all players get the same random game
    - Remove all special treatment of BROKEN GAME, i.e. those games count
    - How will we know when this is happening? Analytics?
- Obfuscate cookies

Testing Issues
==============

In IOS (phone, ipad) using Safari, wordchain.html will load and play OK, BUT:
- if you force a hard reload (cmd-opt-R) from the web inspector while tethered to a Mac,
  the javascript downloading fails for 2-4 of the files.
- also, BaseLogger.js seems to take too long but does download. You can see this in the Web
  Inspector on the Mac when tethered to the iPad. We haven't tethered a phone yet (Nov 8, 2024)
- only occurs when device is tethered

TODO - verify that hard reload doesn't work on iphone/safari (untethered).
TODO - can we force hard-reload on iphone/ipad in Chrome? Does that require tethering?
    NOTE: If we clear the Safari's cache on iPad via Settings --> Safari --> Clear History and Website Data
          and then go back to Safari, the app seems to reload everything just fine (tethered or not).

The JS download failure has strange aspects.
- Web Inspector/network shows that 2-4 JS files never load.
  - They are in the green "waiting" phase, but if you look at the "Headers" tab in WebInspector,
    you will see there are no requests made for those pages.
  - And the web server doesn't show any request.
