Known Bugs
==========

- If Daily game is in progress and we redefine the start/target words for that game
  number in a prod update, it screws up any game in progress or finished that started
  with the previous definition.

Near Term Changes
=================

Do in suggested order?

- Review this TODO file - some of it is done or not relevant
- Analytics
- Add remaining penalties indication (maybe in the header?)
- Eliminate negativity from user experience

New Game Play Ideas
===================

- Change in terminology from "penalty" to "extra steps"
  - No limit on extra steps
- One Show Next Move per game (currently multiple allowed, until game lost).
  - Does it count as an extra step?
  - Display BROWN in game and share (currently gray)
- User move that adds steps displays GRAY in game and share (currently red/orange)
- DODO move adds 2 extra steps
  - Continue to display "Ugh! You added two steps!" toast
  - Continue to display one row of in game and share, but use GRAY (currently red/orange)
- GENIUS move reduces a step (2 steps?)
  - No changes to what we display.
- So score (extra steps) won't always line up with the number of gray (or non-green) rows.
  - Maybe it's OK; at a minimum we need something in the FAQ about it.
  - Put a line under the Nth row to indicate "par" -- number of steps in WC solution.
    - where N is the number of rows in the initial display (after the target word).
    - add styling to the tr for that row (bottom-border: 4px solid)
  - With the "penalties" terminology I think the score always lined up with the number of red rows.
  - Maybe if we display a running "extra step count" at the top it will mitigate that misalignment?
- Stats:
  - Won/Lost now shown as one stat: "Completed"
  - "WRONG MOVE COUNTS" becomes "EXTRA STEP COUNTS"
  - Need to think about migration of stats in cookie ... probably just treat current
    "penalty" values as "extra steps" values.
  - Continue to use "confounded" emoji for scores over N (currently N == 4; maybe we increase it?)
- Streak reflects contiguous completed daily games (no matter how many steps it takes to get there)

Maybe Someday
=============

Affecting Game Play
-------------------
- Another hint approach:
  - When you are changing a letter, letters in the picker that don't form valid
    words (according to either dictionary) would become unselectable.
  - When you are adding a letter, "+" buttons where there are no valid words
    (according to the "common words" dictionary) would become unselectable.
  - When you are deleting a letter, "-" buttons where the result is an invalid
    word would become unselectable.
- Mode where future rows do not have change cells outlined thicker. (harder)
- Allow "overriding" WordChain's suggested next move type (including which letter to change).

Not Affecting Game Play
-----------------------
- Create a back-end that delivers the daily and practice games
- Cookies: make secure? Obfuscate? Save in back-end DB?
- Remove words from dictionary if they have no neighbors.
- Address slow handler violations:
     [Violation] 'click' handler took XXXms
        (can happen when switching to Practice game or starting new Practice game)
     [Violation] 'setInterval' handler took XXXms
        (can happen when the AppDisplay interval timer determines it's time for a new Daily game)

Testing Issues
==============

In IOS (phone, ipad) using Safari, wordchain.html will load and play OK, BUT:
- if you force a hard reload (cmd-opt-R) from the web inspector while tethered to a Mac,
  the javascript downloading fails for 2-4 of the files.
- also, BaseLogger.js seems to take too long but does download. You can see this in the Web
  Inspector on the Mac when tethered to the iPad. We haven't tethered a phone yet (Nov 8, 2024)
- only occurs when device is tethered

TODO - verify that hard reload doesn't work on iphone/safari (untethered).
TODO - can we force hard-reload on iphone/ipad in Chrome? Does that require tethering?
    NOTE: If we clear the Safari's cache on iPad via Settings --> Safari --> Clear History and Website Data
          and then go back to Safari, the app seems to reload everything just fine (tethered or not).

The JS download failure has strange aspects.
- Web Inspector/network shows that 2-4 JS files never load.
  - They are in the green "waiting" phase, but if you look at the "Headers" tab in WebInspector,
    you will see there are no requests made for those pages.
  - And the web server doesn't show any request.
