Bugs
- 'Solved!' toast pops up when changing settings (colorblind or dark modes)
- don't show solution button in Daily Game if the puzzle is either solved or shown

Implementation Ideas (Future)
- Solution button -- add means to show WordChain's ORIGINAL solution?
- After a game fails should the solution be shown?
  If so from the point of failure onward?
  Or by the same means to show WordChain's original solution?
- Possible settings to tweak game difficulty:
  - Mode where future rows do not have change cells outlined thicker. (harder)
  - Mode where picker displays only letters that could result in valid words. (easier)
- Don't make the player select the last letter when there is only one step left? This prevents fat-fingering the last letter choice.

Testing
- Update Manual UI Testing Use Cases doc
  (https://docs.google.com/document/d/10OhXfsQWpEvvLodChFl1e-K8VdjBBmx7-jTihKBI1sE/edit?usp=sharing)
- Update Testing How-To doc
  (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b8b2sDs3SFpffsEPO70uufia7UOJBccSUclHI4u9u8Y/edit?usp=sharing)
  - query parameters for practice games: start, target, minutes_per_day, whatever else
  - red sections

Notes on recovery of daily game

use cases:
1) no recovered game number - calculate current game and initialize it
2) recovered game number - calculate today's game number and compare:
   a) not the same: initialize today's game number
   b) the same: recover played moves and 'shown' flag
      i) shown is false, played moves are complete
          recover the game as solved
      ii) shown is false, played moves are incomplete
          recover the game in progress
      iii) shown is true, played moves are complete
           recover the game as finished, leave shown flag as true
      iv) shown is true, played moves are incomplete: 
          this is a bug.  finish playing the game, save the solved state, leave 'shown' flag as true

For testing, the test script needs to fix the puzzle number in advance.  Right now we do this using
?testing URL flag that sets the game number to -1.  But this causes problems for recovery testing,
because ?testing forces a brand new game instead of recovering.  
For testing, we should control only the beginning of the epoch and 'now'.  DailyGameNumber depends
only on the difference of these.  'now' can be automatic, and the epoch can be adjusted in Test.js
to arrive at the desired daily game number.  For now, we can leave SHORT .. POOR as a known
daily game and test against it.  This means SHORT POOR will be a daily puzzle.  But is it a good game?
Yes - difficulty 24, choices per step are 2,4,9,6,3.  
The overriding in Test.js should be in CODE, not a QueryVar.  Just override the static epoch value before
a test and restore it after.
