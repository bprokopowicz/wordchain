Implementation
- Solution button -- add means to show WordChain's ORIGINAL solution?
- After a game fails should the solution be shown?
  If so from the point of failure onward?
  Or by the same means to show WordChain's solution?
- Possible settings to tweak game difficulty:
  - Mode where future rows do not have change cells outlined thicker. (harder)
  - Mode where picker displays only letters that could result in valid words. (easier)
- Resolve all TODOs!

Testing
- Document how to run tests - js and python.
- Update test plan (https://docs.google.com/document/d/10OhXfsQWpEvvLodChFl1e-K8VdjBBmx7-jTihKBI1sE/edit?usp=sharing)
- Tweak for display on iPhone/iPad
- share tests
    - game finished on deletion.  Probably this will require a way to force the daily game using the 
      the URL query string to set the start and target to something that finishes with a deletion.

Before Sharing with Initial Friends
- Review help message
- 30 days of daily games
