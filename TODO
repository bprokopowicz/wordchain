Implementation Ideas (Future)
- Solution button -- add means to show WordChain's ORIGINAL solution?
- After a game fails should the solution be shown?
  If so from the point of failure onward?
  Or by the same means to show WordChain's original solution?
- Possible settings to tweak game difficulty:
  - Mode where future rows do not have change cells outlined thicker. (harder)
  - Mode where picker displays only letters that could result in valid words. (easier)
- Don't make the player select the last letter when there is only one step left? This prevents fat-fingering the last letter choice.

- Consider removing words that are in both dictionaries from the Scrabble dictionary

daily game use cases:
1) no recovered game number - calculate current game and initialize it
    dailyGameNormalFinishStatsTest
2) recovered game number - calculate today's game number and compare:
   a) not the same: initialize today's game number 
       - dailyGameUnfinishedRestartNextDay()
   b) the same: recover played moves and 'shown' flag
      i) shown is false, played moves are complete
          recover the game as solved
          - finishDailyGameRestartTest()
      ii) shown is false, played moves are incomplete
          recover the game in progress
          - continueDailyGameRestartTest()
      iii) shown is true, played moves are complete
           recover the game as finished, leave shown flag as true
           - dailyGameShowSolutionTest()
      iv) shown is true, played moves are incomplete:
          this is a bug.  finish playing the game, save the solved state, leave 'shown' flag as true

Testing issues:

The app tests would hang on opening/initializing some of the tests.  It seems to be fixed by specifying width, height for the 
window.open() call.  This makes it use a new window instead of tab.  

There is another problem, with loading the game itself, including during testing.  In IOS (phone, ipad) using Safari, wordchain.html will load and play OK,
but if you force a hard reload (cmd-opt-R) from the web inspector while tethered to a mac, the javascript downloading fails for 
2-4 of the files. Also, BaseLogger.js seems to take too long but does download.  You can see this in the Web Inspector on the mac
when tethered to the iPad.  We haven't tethered a phone yet (nov 8, 2024)  
TODO - verify that hard reload doesn't work on iphone/safari.
TODO - can we force hard-reload on iphone/itab in Chrome?  Does that require tethering?

    NOTE: If we clear the Safari's cache on iPad via Settings --> Safari --> Clear History and Website Data
          and then go back to Safari, the app seems to reload everything just fine (tethered or not).

The JS download failure has strange aspects.  Web Inspector/network shows that 2-4 JS files never load. They are in the green "waiting" phase, but
if you look at the "Headers" tab in WebInspector, you will see there are no requests made for those pages.  And the web server doesn't show any
request.
