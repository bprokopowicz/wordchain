Daily game on restart
If a game is finished, on reloading, it seems to put you one step from finished.  When you come back to a solved daily game,
what should you see?

Implementation
- Solution button -- add means to show WordChain's ORIGINAL solution?
- After a game fails should the solution be shown?
  If so from the point of failure onward?
  Or by the same means to show WordChain's solution?
- Possible settings to tweak game difficulty:
  - Mode where future rows do not have change cells outlined thicker. (harder)
  - Mode where picker displays only letters that could result in valid words. (easier)
- Resolve all TOODs!
