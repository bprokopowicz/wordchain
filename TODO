Known Bugs
==========

- If Daily game is in progress and we redefine the start/target words for that game
  number in a prod update, it screws up any game in progress or finished that started
  with the previous definition.

Near Term Changes
=================

Do in suggested order?

- Review this TODO file - some of it is done or not relevant
- Add a one-time pop-up/notice: swipe the letter tiles left and right, then tap a letter to select it.
- Make picker slider always visible (we failed on this, righ?)
- Analytics
- Add remaining penalties indication (maybe in the header?)
- Less negative user experience

Less Negative User Experience / Game Play
=========================================

- Change in terminology from "penalty" to "extra steps"
  - No limit on extra steps?
  - Increase limit?
- One Show Next Move per game (currently multiple allowed, until game lost).
  - Does it count as an extra step?
  - Display BROWN in game and share (currently gray)
- User move that adds steps displays GRAY in game and share (currently red/orange)
- DODO move adds 2 extra steps
  - Continue to display "Ugh! You added two steps!" toast
  - Continue to display one row of "extra step color" (GRAY) in game and share
- GENIUS move reduces step(s) 
  - No changes to what we display.
  - But score will be affected.
- Score is # of extra steps
  - Won't always line up with the number of gray/brown rows.
    - With the "penalties" terminology I think the score always lines up with the number of red rows.
    - Maybe it's OK; at a minimum we need something in the FAQ about it.
  - Display a running "extra step count" (in the header?)
    - May mitigate that misalignment.
  - Display a line under the Nth row to indicate "par" -- number of steps in WC solution.
    - N is the number of rows in the initial display (after the target word).
    - Add styling to the <tr> for that row (bottom-border: 4px solid)
    - This also may mitigate score != # gray/brown misalignment. 
- Stats
  - Won/Lost now shown as one stat: "Completed"
  - "WRONG MOVE COUNTS" becomes "EXTRA STEP COUNTS"
  - Continue to use "confounded" emoji for scores over N (currently N == 4; maybe we increase it?)
  - Streak reflects contiguous completed daily games (no matter how many steps it takes to get there)
  - Need to think about migration of stats in cookie ... probably just treat current
    "penalty" values as "extra steps" values.

Analytics
=========
There is a class called Metrics.java that records event+data by fetching a URL with event+data in the 
query string.  Data includes a word-chain player ID (WCID) which is persistent per player-platform.  The
file fetched is wcm.html.  This file has Google analytics in it.  
Our Google tag ID is G-ESCKD20EKK.  This is a Google Analytics 4 (GA4) tag.  
It seems like GA4 supports counting events by type but not by individual user.  So we can track things like:
- game #abc started at timestamp
- game #abc finished in N moves, streak at K, at timestamp
Things we can't do or maybe complicated:
- user WCIDxyz has played 43 games

Maybe Someday
=============

Affecting Game Play
-------------------
- Another hint approach:
  - When you are changing a letter, letters in the picker that don't form valid
    words (according to either dictionary) would become unselectable.
  - When you are adding a letter, "+" buttons where there are no valid words
    (according to the "common words" dictionary) would become unselectable.
  - When you are deleting a letter, "-" buttons where the result is an invalid
    word would become unselectable.
- Mode where future rows do not have change cells outlined thicker. (harder)
- Allow "overriding" WordChain's suggested next move type (including which letter to change).
  - 'My Way' button
  - Will need to bring back keyboard
  - Still must conform to single change per move (add/del/change one letter)
- Option to exclude advanced dictionary from being used.
  - Addresses Steven's irritation:
    - Getting dinged when a word is in the advanced dictionary, and results
      in a longer path using only words from common dictionary, when an equal
      path using other words in advanced dictionary is possible.
    - But maybe the 'My Way' button would obviate the need for this?

Not Affecting Game Play
-----------------------
- Create a back-end that delivers the daily and practice games
- Cookies: make secure? Obfuscate? Save in back-end DB?
- Remove words from dictionary if they have no neighbors.
- Address slow handler violations:
     [Violation] 'click' handler took XXXms
        (can happen when switching to Practice game or starting new Practice game)
     [Violation] 'setInterval' handler took XXXms
        (can happen when the AppDisplay interval timer determines it's time for a new Daily game)

Testing Issues
==============

In IOS (phone, ipad) using Safari, wordchain.html will load and play OK, BUT:
- if you force a hard reload (cmd-opt-R) from the web inspector while tethered to a Mac,
  the javascript downloading fails for 2-4 of the files.
- also, BaseLogger.js seems to take too long but does download. You can see this in the Web
  Inspector on the Mac when tethered to the iPad. We haven't tethered a phone yet (Nov 8, 2024)
- only occurs when device is tethered

TODO - verify that hard reload doesn't work on iphone/safari (untethered).
TODO - can we force hard-reload on iphone/ipad in Chrome? Does that require tethering?
    NOTE: If we clear the Safari's cache on iPad via Settings --> Safari --> Clear History and Website Data
          and then go back to Safari, the app seems to reload everything just fine (tethered or not).

The JS download failure has strange aspects.
- Web Inspector/network shows that 2-4 JS files never load.
  - They are in the green "waiting" phase, but if you look at the "Headers" tab in WebInspector,
    you will see there are no requests made for those pages.
  - And the web server doesn't show any request.
