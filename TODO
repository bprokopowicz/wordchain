Production TODO
===============

Must Do
-------
- How to create/minify/obfuscate one big js file?
- Buy domain wordchain.com or some such?
- Where to host?
- How to manage daily game words long-term?
- Address/remove any TODO-PRODUCTION
- Change Const.WORD_CHAIN_EPOCH_DATE
- Fix Const.PRACTICE_GAMES_PER_DAY
- Remove all rare words from standard dictionary (done through 'B') 1/29

Discuss
-------

BLP says we should do these:
- Consider changing Practice game window to align with Daily game window

BLP says only do these if it really catches on:
- Create a back-end that delivers the daily and practice games
- Cookies: make secure? Obfuscate? Save in back-end DB?
- Mode where future rows do not have change cells outlined thicker. (harder)

BLP says ask what our Beta users think on these:
- Don't make the player select the last letter when there is only one step left?
- Show Solution
  - Should it require confirmation?
  - Should letters in "shown" rows be a different color (currently green, maybe show gray)?

BLP has no opinion on:
- Address slow handler violations:
     [Violation] 'click' handler took XXXms
        (can happen when switching to Practice game or starting new Practice game)
     [Violation] 'setInterval' handler took XXXms
        (can happen when the AppDisplay interval timer determines it's time for a new Daily game)

Issues

Testing Issues
==============

In IOS (phone, ipad) using Safari, wordchain.html will load and play OK, BUT:
- if you force a hard reload (cmd-opt-R) from the web inspector while tethered to a Mac,
  the javascript downloading fails for 2-4 of the files.
- also, BaseLogger.js seems to take too long but does download. You can see this in the Web
  Inspector on the Mac when tethered to the iPad. We haven't tethered a phone yet (Nov 8, 2024)
- only occurs when device is tethered

TODO - verify that hard reload doesn't work on iphone/safari (untethered).
TODO - can we force hard-reload on iphone/ipad in Chrome? Does that require tethering?
    NOTE: If we clear the Safari's cache on iPad via Settings --> Safari --> Clear History and Website Data
          and then go back to Safari, the app seems to reload everything just fine (tethered or not).

The JS download failure has strange aspects.
- Web Inspector/network shows that 2-4 JS files never load.
  - They are in the green "waiting" phase, but if you look at the "Headers" tab in WebInspector,
    you will see there are no requests made for those pages.
  - And the web server doesn't show any request.
