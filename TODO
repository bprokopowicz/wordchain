Daily game on restart
1) localstorage seems to be one behind in the words played array: In game SALTED -> FISH i played
SATED
SATE
FATE
but the localstorage array has 
[["SALTED", true, "ok"], ["SATED", true, "ok"], ["FATED", true, "ok"], ["FATE", false, "ok"],â€¦]
and on restart, the game shows FATED played and the next move should be to remove D giving FATE, again.
This problem begins before the first word played.  The start word is saved in the played words array but 
shown as FALSE.  This is daily game number 4

2) when you force debugStaticDaily using URL?testing, or if it is true from previous test, the game doesn't restore the daily game
at all.  This is probably because that path forces the static test from the start.  Why doesn't it understand the (static) daily game in 
progress?  I think that, on restart, the daily game number is recalculated from the days elapsed since T0, and if that number is different
from the recovered dailygamenumber

Implementation
- Solution button -- add means to show WordChain's ORIGINAL solution?
- After a game fails should the solution be shown?
  If so from the point of failure onward?
  Or by the same means to show WordChain's solution?
- Possible settings to tweak game difficulty:
  - Mode where future rows do not have change cells outlined thicker. (harder)
  - Mode where picker displays only letters that could result in valid words. (easier)
- Resolve all TOODs!


Testing
- Document how to run tests - js and python.
- Update test plan (https://docs.google.com/document/d/10OhXfsQWpEvvLodChFl1e-K8VdjBBmx7-jTihKBI1sE/edit?usp=sharing)
- Tweak for display on iPhone/iPad
- Stats tests
